# password-generator

How many letters would you like in your password?

How many symbols would you like?

How many numbers would you like?

4 letters
2 symbols and
3 numbers
then the password might look like this: fgdx$*924

In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:

x$d24g*f9

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
